<ol>
<li><p>Install Emacs. Get a nice, modern pre-built binary from
<a href="http://emacsformacosx.com/">Emacs For Mac OS X</a>. It even supports fullscreen
mode</p></li>
<li><p>Install <a href="http://batsov.com/prelude/">Emacs Prelude</a> which provides a useful,
opinionated emacs environment which is easily configured.</p></li>
<li><p>Install clisp. I use homebrew so <code>brew install clisp</code> takes care of that for
me.</p></li>
<li><p>Install <a href="http://quicklisp.org">quicklisp</a>; from Terminal go to a temporary
directory and download quicklisp.lisp with <code>curl -O
http://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp</code>. Then run the lisp file from clisp
with <code>clisp-i quicklisp.lisp</code>. As the instructions say, evaluate
<code>(quicklisp-quickstart:install)</code>, and then evaluate <code>(ql:add-to-init-file)</code>
to load quicklisp along with lisp.</p></li>
<li><p>Install Slime. While you have the clisp repl open, evaluate <code>(ql:quickload
"quicklisp-slime-helper")</code>. After this runs, you will see some
recommendations for what to put into your .emacs file. You don't need to do
this. I did say that Prelude was opinionated, and it's done this for
you. However, it's not set up for clisp, so instead, add this to your
<code>personal/personal.el</code> file: <code>(setq slime-default-lisp 'clisp)</code></p></li>
<li><p>And that should be it. You don't need to have the clisp repl running in the
terminal anymore, and you can delete the <code>quicklisp.lisp</code> file that you
downladed, as it's done it's job of installation now.</p></li>
<li><p>Test the setup from Emacs by running <code>M-x slime-mode</code> and you'll be taken to
the lisp REPL.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Now that's done you can go on to the hard part of actually learning and using lisp.</p>
