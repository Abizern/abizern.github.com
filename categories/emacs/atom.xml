<a href="https://peepcode.com/blog/2012/commanding-your-text-editor">Commanding Your Text Editor</a>

programmer or not. Those of you who know me will have heard me talking about the
Dvorak keyboard layout and my current attraction to Emacs.</p>

Emacs bindings are supported natively on the Mac, and unlike Vim; you don't need
to be in a different mode to use them.</p>
