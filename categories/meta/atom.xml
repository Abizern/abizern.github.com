    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the obligatory post announcing that I've moved this site off Wordpress
to <a href="http://Octopress.org" title="Octopress - The blogging framework for
hackers">Octopress</a>. It's been almost a year since I posted anything. And most of what I
did publish was about <a href="http://nscodernightlondon.com" title="NSCoder
Night London's page">NSCoder Night</a>.</p>

<p>The old site had the Solarized Dark theme - and once I saw that the code
formatting on Octopress was that by default I decided to make the move. Now I
can happily write Markdown formatted posts with Emacs and see an almost live
preview of how it will look when published. I get to keep it on
<a href="http://github.com" title="GitHub">GitHub</a> and have it in a repository.</p>

<p>I've tried to set the general colours to Solarized Light. Seems okay so far but
still plenty of room for tweaking.</p>
