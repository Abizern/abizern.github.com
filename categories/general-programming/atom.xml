    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I mentored at <a href="http://zen.coderdojo.com/dojo/74">CoderDojo London</a> this
weekend. These are just some of my thoughts about it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><blockquote><p>CoderDojo is a movement orientated around running free not-for-profit coding clubs and regular sessions for young people.</p><footer><strong>Coder Dojo site</strong> <cite><a href='http://coderdojo.com/about-us/'>coderdojo.com/about-us/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>A regular London chapter has formed, supported by and at the offices of
<a href="http://forwardtechnology.co.uk">Forward Technology</a>.  It takes place in their
canteen/theatre which has a nice tiered seating area and a miked up
presentation stand.</p>

<p>It's still the Easter break, but 6 kids turned up with laptops ready to carry on
with projects they had already started and learn new stuff.  It started with a
presentation of what the day's agenda was, which I mostly zoned out of as I was
busy churning through the Javascript tutorial on
<a href="http://codecademy.co.uk">Codecademy</a> which was going to covered. I'm not a web
developer so I didn't want to show myself up.</p>

<p>After the opening talk the kids started burning through the tutorials at a
breakneck pace.  Where I went through them a bit slower; they hammered through
the interactive tutorial without (seemingly) worrying about learning what they
were doing. But that wasn't the case.  Each succeeding question depended on
knowledge gained in the previous one, and they obviously had retained it. The
mentors watched them going through the exercises and answered questions.  I may
not know Javascript, but I can spot syntax errors and misspelled commands like a
BOSS.  So I wasn't useless as I was worried I would be.</p>

<p>After that section (and after a few breaks - these are kids after all) Adam got
everyone to open
<a href="http://elucidatedbinary.com/recanvas">elucidatedbinary.com/recanvas</a> where you
can draw straight into web page and see the results right as you code. And then
step by step got them to follow along first creating a line, then a rectangle
then filling in the rectangle then drawing circles, arcs and trying to draw the
first initial of your name.</p>

<p>This was the most fun of the afternoon. Seeing the results instantaneously
really drove them along. They changed the points to see what would happen
without worrying about what they were doing. The mentors were kept busy helping
them with the syntax, explaing the difference between starting a line and
drawing a line, the coordinate system, points, colours, line thickness. These
were youngsters who don't know their way about a keyboard as most of the rest of
us do, but I didn't want to correct them because it would break the flow of what
they were doing. I had to draw the letter shapes on paper a couple of times and
walk them through the process of working out what the coordinates of each point
should be.</p>

<p>I showed one girl how to draw an arc on the canvas, went away and when I came
back she proudly showed me that she'd put two filled circles above the
arc to make a smiley face. Without being told to or shown how.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Helping kids program is hard. You can&#8217;t tell them to RTFM'>
One of the extra tasks was to modify a function to draw on the canvas when the
mouse was pressed. I saw one boy go to Stack Overflow, find a similar solution,
and then, rather than just copy-pasting the code, he turned to me and asked me
to explain <code>mousedown</code> to him. (A lesson that many people could stand to learn).
I tweeted about it later:
Helping kids program is hard. You can't tell them to RTFM.
Since I would have to refer to the said FM to answer him properly,
I deferred the question to someone who knew what he was talking about.
</span></p>

<p>It was an energising experience. The program is in the early days yet, there
isn't a program of tasks to cover. But the enthusiasm of the children and the
mentors is the driving force at the moment.</p>

<p>If you have or know of someone who would be interested in this. Either as a
mentor or a student, please, let them know about it. The sessions are free to
attend, take place in Camden Town on Saturdays between 12-3. You can sign up
with EventBrite, which gives an idea of how many attendees there will be and how
many mentors are available.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many times you will see a shortened url but you aren't sure what it points
at. Here's a little tip that I picked up from
<a href="http://tommorris.org">Tom Morris</a>.</p>

<p>Pop open your terminal, or console, or whatever your command-line application is
and type the following:</p>

<p><code>bash
curl --head shorturl
</code></p>

<p>This pops up a short amount of useful information about the target url. For
example the response for the Google short URL for this site shows this;</p>

<p><code>bash
~ % curl --head http://goo.gl/oQx8
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently

<p>And you can see that the Location shows that you aren't going to get
Rick-rolled.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On New Year's eve, Dámasa asked me to calculate some fraction of a fraction and
provide the answer as a fraction in eighths. The post had just arrived so I
flipped over an envelope and started working it out.</p>

<p>"Why do you need the answer in eighths?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Because I'm trying to convert a recipe and my scales only go down to eighths of an ounce."</p>

<p>"Why don't you just use grams?"</p>

<p>"…"</p>

<p>This little episode reminded me of an
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/alex_papadimoulis/archive/2005/05/25/408925.aspx">article</a>
by Alex Papadimoulis where he used the analogy of being asked whether it was
better to use a bottle or a shoe to pound a nail. Although there are situations
where either could be used, the real answer is, of course, to use a
hammer. Sometimes we are asked questions to which we can provide an answer; but
perhaps we should first stop and ask the reason for the question before
answering it.</p>

<p>Let's take <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> as an example. The
programmer's question and answer site that is also a game. 'Good' behaviour,
such as asking good questions, providing helpful answers, are rewarded by
upvotes, 'bad' behaviour; lazy questions, incorrect answers, are discouraged by
downvotes. It is becoming increasingly common to find a Stack Overflow link as
the top hit when searching the web for answers to programming questions. But, if
you follow a mailing list for your chosen speciality it isn't hard to see the
same question in both places and different approaches to answering them.</p>

<p>Stack Overflow's
<a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/19665/the-help-vampire-problem/19673#19673">recommended approach</a>
to <a href="http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/">help vampires</a> is a pragmatic
one. Essentially, you can either be aloof and use the tools of the site to
discourage the behaviour; or you could just answer the question and get some
points. On a mailing list like, say, CocoaDev, a weak question will get sharp
answers (if any); but on Stack Overflow, somebody might just answer the question
because they get something out of it.</p>

<p>This might be useful to somebody. I'm sure there are times where we all just
need a quick answer to question without deeper knowledge. Get help with the
'how' to get something done, and pick up on the 'why' later.  But read enough
questions in public forums and you'll soon recognise those who just want to know
the 'how', and no amount of saying they need to learn the basics is going to
help. Maybe back up and ask why they are asking so you can better answer their
question.</p>

<p>To tie this back to fractions, have a look at this
<a href="http://republicofmath.wordpress.com/2010/01/08/richard-skemps-relational-understanding-and-instrumental-understanding/">Republic of Math post</a>
about the difference between relational and instrumental understanding in
mathematics. A particular example is how the invert and multiply method of
fractional division is widely taught without actually developing an
understanding of the operation itself. When I was 14 my elder brother taught me
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative">differentiation</a>. Not by saying
"subtract one from the exponent and multiply", but rather by drawing a curve and
working through calculating a tangent using deltas and differences tending to
zero and how it led to the simpler method. I've long forgotten the hard way, but
after that I was very good at calculus.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is something to think about next time you see somebody ask how to
write an application without using Interface Builder.</p>
