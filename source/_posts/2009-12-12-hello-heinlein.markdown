![Heinlein theme image](http://abizern.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/screenshot.png) The Hemingway wordpress theme used to be quite popular. I like [Hemingway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway), and I also like [Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinlein), so it seemed a good name for the theme of this rebranded site. I've brought a few of the posts over from the old place [Stompy.org](http://stompy.org), mostly to do with NSCoder Night in London.





There is more about this you can read in the [about page](http://abizern.org/about). I also hold my hand up to stealing some of the designs I used form [Nik Fletcher](http://nikf.org) and [Alex Payne](http://al3x.net/) I've also got my eyes on some other sites that I want to grab inspiration from. I make no claim to being a web developer, so feel free to send constructive criticism. I haven't finished with this yet.



They say that good artists borrow, and great artists steal. But real artists ship.
