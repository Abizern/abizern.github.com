title: NSCoder Night London Now Has It's Own Page
categories:
- NSCoder Night

It's been over a year that I've been running the NSCoder Night meetings in
London from here, but I've now moved it to a site of its own. You can now get
all the information from
[NSCoderNightLondon.com](http://nscodernightlondon.com).

Blog style entries never really worked. I hope that having everything together
in just a few pages on a site makes it easier for people who want to turn up.

XBI hope that it floats up higher in Google Rankings as well. This will also make
it easier for people who want to turn up.
