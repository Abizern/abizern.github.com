[![December NSCoder Night](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2639/4200693262_1ca99e79e7.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/15729248@N00/4200693262)

The London chapter of NSCoder night closed the year in style. More developers than ever attended travelling in to London from as far as Brighton, Cambridge, Reading and Colchester. A very crowded and noisy pub meant that it was more of a social occasion with laptops being brought out only now and again. The picture was taken early on so it doesn't look that croweded, but we ended up taking over the whole corner. The numbers were also swelled by combining it with the London CocoaHeads group this month.

Thank you to everyone for coming out and making these monthly gatherings a success. We'll start again in January, just as the wind up to NSConference starts. Keep an eye on the feed and the calendar for up to date information.

Seasons greetings to you all!
