For those who haven't noticed, the next meeting is on Tuesday, December 15, 2009 at 7pm ish. at the Bunch of Grapes pub in Borough. We're usually upstairs and are easy to spot. If you still want to be sure, drop me a line and I'll send you my mobile number. WiFi can be spotty at the pub so calling me if you're lost is probably better than resorting to the great communication medium of our time that is [twitter](http://twitter.com/)





There may be some books brought along so people can look through them if they are considering buying them.: [Coders At Work](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Coders-Work-Reflections-Craft-Programming/dp/1430219483/), [Cocoa Design Patterns](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cocoa-Design-Patterns-Developers-Library/dp/0321535022/), [Core Data](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Core-Data-Apples-Persisting-Under/dp/1934356328/), [Xcode3 book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Xcode-3-Unleashed-Fritz-Anderson/dp/0321552636/), [Head First Design Patterns](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Freeman/dp/0596007124/), [Head First Javascript](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Head-First-JavaScript-Michael-Morrison/dp/0596527748/). Please let me know if your interested in any of these; I don't mind bringing them along, but not just for the sake of it. Particularly the Head First books, which have a _unique_ approach which looks strange to a lot of people, so they are worth a look.
