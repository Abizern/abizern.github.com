You may have occasion to rename an Xcode project.




You can find step-by-step instructions and scripts with a little bit of Googling. But there is another way. If you're running Xcode 3.2 on Snow Leopard there is a menu item you can use instead. Have a look at the Project > Rename… menu item instead.
