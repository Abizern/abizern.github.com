Sorry for the late notice but there _is_ an NSCoder Night London on Tuesday, January 19th at 7pm ish. at the [Bunch of Grapes](http://www.bunchofgrapesborough.com) in Borough. Google Maps isn't accurate, so use [this](http://embr.it/nscodernightlondon) map to find it. I've booked a table upstairs so we won't have to hang around waiting to find a place to sit.





WiFi can be spotty in the pub, so if you want to be sure to find us drop me a message and I'll let you have my mobile number. There is food available until 9pm if you're likely to be hungry. Unfortunately, there is a minimum age of 21.





As usual, you don't have to bring a laptop and code; you can just come and be social.





Finally, at one of last year's meetings, mention was made of having a Cocoa hackday along the lines of [CocoaDevHouse](http://cocoadevhouse.org). If you have any ideas for this or have experience in setting up these kinds of events I'd love to talk to you about taking this further.





See you tomorrow.
