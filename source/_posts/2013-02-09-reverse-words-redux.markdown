Gearing up for this year's Google Code Jam I revisited some of the older Haskell
code that I wrote for practice previously. One that I put up here, about the
[Reverse Words] problem was a little wordier than I would do now:

{% gist 4745085 %}

Shorter code, simple input and output indirection, and a monadic for loop.

What a difference (less than) a year makes.
