      <description>This is the obligatory post announcing that I&amp;rsquo;ve moved this site off Wordpress to Octopress. It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a year since I posted anything. And most of what I did publish was about NSCoder Night.
The old site had the Solarized Dark theme - and once I saw that the code formatting on Octopress was that by default I decided to make the move. Now I can happily write Markdown formatted posts with Emacs and see an almost live preview of how it will look when published.</description>
