      <title>Correcting Brace Layout</title>

      <description>I wrote a small rubygem called fixbraces to move the opening brace of a conditional to the same line as the opening statement.
So now I can correct all the Xcode generated stubs that look like:
- (void)someMethod { // some code here }  Into my preferred format:
- (void)someMethod { // some code here }  Which fits with my personal coding standards.</description>

      <title>On Live Coding</title>

      <description>I read somewhere that part of the popularity of The West Wing was that it was entertaining to watch smart people solve difficult problems. I think that&amp;rsquo;s part of the reason why I find watching live coding videos so entertaining - It&amp;rsquo;s more fun to watch someone solve a problem than doing it yourself.
There are plenty of screencasts you can find - YouTube is an obvious one, but don&amp;rsquo;t forget Vimeo.</description>
