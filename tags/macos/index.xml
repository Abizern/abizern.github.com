      <title>Setting up for Lisp on OS X</title>

      <description>This is how I roll, you might choose a different path.
 Install Emacs. Get a nice, modern pre-built binary from Emacs For Mac OS X. It even supports fullscreen mode
 Install Emacs Prelude which provides a useful, opinionated emacs environment which is easily configured.
 Install clisp. I use homebrew so brew install clisp takes care of that for me.
 Install quicklisp; from Terminal go to a temporary directory and download quicklisp.</description>

      <title>Missing Xcode Toolbar</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve been there.
You&amp;rsquo;re working in Xcode, and you have a file opened on another monitor in another window. Unfortunately, you forget about it, and when you close your project and reopen it again, the toolbar is missing.
It can be frustrating, because Xcode remembers this, and every time you open the project it will open without a toolbar. You can put it back by right-clicking in what is left of the toolbar and choosing one of the options.</description>

      <title>UUID Strings with Cocoa</title>
      <link>http://abizern.org/2012/uuid-strings-with-cocoa/</link>

      <description>This used to be a thing until the iOS 6 and OS X 10.8 compatible NSUUID Class became available.
New This is how you can do it now:
NSString *uuidString = [[NSUUID UUID] UUIDString]; // Generates: 7E60066C-C7F3-438A-95B1-DDE8634E1072  Old Here&amp;rsquo;s a method you can put in a class, with the correct ARC casts on ownership, that returns a UUID. It&amp;rsquo;s a fairly common technique, and you&amp;rsquo;ll even see versions of it where people have created a category on NSString for this.</description>

      <title>Simple Localisation Testing</title>
      <link>http://abizern.org/2012/simple-localisation-testing/</link>

      <description>Sometimes you want to test your localisations but you don&amp;rsquo;t want to go through the hassle of changing the settings on the simulator, or device, or your Mac for each one. There&amp;rsquo;s always the fear of setting some language that you don&amp;rsquo;t understand.
But, with Xcode4 schemes and a little argument passing this is a lot easier than it used to be. You can set up a scheme for each localisation which will let you run your iOS or Mac app under that localisation without having to change any settings.</description>

      <title>Just Enough GPG for git</title>
      <link>http://abizern.org/2011/just-enough-gpg-for-git/</link>

      <description>It came about that I wanted to do some work with git and signed tags. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I had looked at this, I&amp;rsquo;ve got some old entries up on keyservers that date back to 1999, and never on a Mac.
It turns out that it is quite simple to set up a minimal GPG environment â€“ one that lets you work on the command line without having to set it up for Mail.</description>
