      <title>Hakyll New Post With Emacs</title>

      <description>When this blog was created using Octopress, a new post could be created by simply running rake new_post in the Terminal. There is no such convenience in Hakyll, which is currently used as the generator. A small thing, but I wanted to fix it.
I could have created a similar Rake task, or shell script to do this, and there are even examples to be found on Hakyll&amp;rsquo;s site. But since I&amp;rsquo;m usually in Emacs when I want to write a new post, I thought it would be a good excuse to write a little lisp.</description>

      <description>This site is now being generated by Hakyll instead of Octopress
It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning on doing for a while, but feeling a bit burned out on Objective-C / Cocoa and facing a few days downtime over the seasonal holidays now was the time to actually do it.
Octopress is nice, and if you are just using the default theme, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get up and running fairly quickly. But I found that updating the site for new versions of Octopress was fragile.</description>

      <description>This is the obligatory post announcing that I&amp;rsquo;ve moved this site off Wordpress to Octopress. It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a year since I posted anything. And most of what I did publish was about NSCoder Night.
The old site had the Solarized Dark theme - and once I saw that the code formatting on Octopress was that by default I decided to make the move. Now I can happily write Markdown formatted posts with Emacs and see an almost live preview of how it will look when published.</description>
