      <description>It came about that I wanted to do some work with git and signed tags. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I had looked at this, I&amp;rsquo;ve got some old entries up on keyservers that date back to 1999, and never on a Mac.
It turns out that it is quite simple to set up a minimal GPG environment â€“ one that lets you work on the command line without having to set it up for Mail.</description>
