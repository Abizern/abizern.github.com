      <description>&amp;ldquo;A coding dojo is a safe place to deliberately practice and develop your coding skills.&amp;rdquo;
I went to my first London Python Dojo last night and had a better time than I expected. I know a little Python (just enough to hurt myself). I was intrigued by this event where the idea was to learn together rather than just share knowledge.
The evening started off with beer and pizza, thanks to our hosts Fry-IT, and then moved on to two short presentations.</description>
