      <description>I read somewhere that part of the popularity of The West Wing was that it was entertaining to watch smart people solve difficult problems. I think that&amp;rsquo;s part of the reason why I find watching live coding videos so entertaining - It&amp;rsquo;s more fun to watch someone solve a problem than doing it yourself.
There are plenty of screencasts you can find - YouTube is an obvious one, but don&amp;rsquo;t forget Vimeo.</description>

      <description>I mentored at CoderDojo London this weekend. These are just some of my thoughts about it.
CoderDojo is a movement orientated around running free not-for-profit coding clubs and regular sessions for young people.
A regular London chapter has formed, supported by and at the offices of Forward Technology. It takes place in their canteen/theatre which has a nice tiered seating area and a miked up presentation stand.
It&amp;rsquo;s still the Easter break, but 6 kids turned up with laptops ready to carry on with projects they had already started and learn new stuff.</description>

      <description>On New Year&amp;rsquo;s eve, DÃ¡masa asked me to calculate some fraction of a fraction and provide the answer as a fraction in eighths. The post had just arrived so I flipped over an envelope and started working it out.
&amp;ldquo;Why do you need the answer in eighths?&amp;rdquo; I asked, while making calculations.
&amp;ldquo;Because I&amp;rsquo;m trying to convert a recipe and my scales only go down to eighths of an ounce.&amp;rdquo;</description>
