      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been over a year that I&amp;rsquo;ve been running the NSCoder Night meetings in London from here, but I&amp;rsquo;ve now moved it to a site of its own. You can now get all the information from NSCoderNightLondon.com.
Blog style entries never really worked. I hope that having everything together in just a few pages on a site makes it easier for people who want to turn up.
I hope that it floats up higher in Google Rankings as well.</description>

      <description>The first London NSCoder Night was a success!
Eleven people turned up, travelling from as far as Brighton and Reading to join in the fun. There was a mix of indies, learners, small Mac shops and students.
We started off upstairs at the Bunch of Grapes and then moved to the outside area for more room. The tables outside are at a comfortable height for standing around so people were able to move around to different groups.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s surprising that there isn&amp;rsquo;t an NSCoder Night chapter in London. There is a monthly CocoaHeads meeting in Swindon, and the UK Mac Dev meeting once a month in Central London, but I think that there is a gap for an evening of coding in a social setting.
So, in the spirit of &amp;ldquo;If you build it, they will come&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and get this started. This Tuesday, September 22, from about 7, let&amp;rsquo;s get together at the Bunch of Grapes pub just behind London Bridge Station map.</description>
