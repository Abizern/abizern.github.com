    <p>I got through the qualification round for Google Code Jam 2014. I usually manage to get through this stage; it’s the first round that I haven’t managed to get past yet.</p>
<p>The easiest question was A-Magic Trick. Nothing much to do here but count the number of similarities between two arrays, easily achieved with the <code>interact</code> method.</p>
<p>The only gotcha in this problem was that the index of the rows to check is 1-based, and most programming languages use 0-based indexing.</p>

                Hakyll New Post With Emacs

    <p>When this blog was created using Octopress, a new post could be created by simply running <code>rake new_post</code> in the Terminal. There is no such convenience in Hakyll, which is currently used as the generator. A small thing, but I wanted to fix it.</p>
<p>I could have created a similar Rake task, or shell script to do this, and there are even examples to be <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/examples.html">found</a> on Hakyll’s site. But since I’m usually in Emacs when I want to write a new post, I thought it would be a good excuse to write a little lisp. And so, here is my first attempt.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode commonlisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp">(<span class="kw">defun</span><span class="fu"> hakyll-site-location </span>()
  <span class="st">&quot;Return the location of the Hakyll files.&quot;</span>

  <span class="st">&quot;Create a new Hakyll post for today with TITLE and TAGS.&quot;</span>
  (interactive <span class="st">&quot;sTitle: </span>\n<span class="st">sTags: &quot;</span>)
  (<span class="kw">let</span> ((file-name (hakyll-post-title title)))
    (set-buffer (get-buffer-create file-name))
    (markdown-mode)
    (insert
     (<span class="kw">format</span> <span class="st">&quot;---</span>\n<span class="st">title: %s</span>\n<span class="st">tags: %s</span>\n<span class="st">description: </span>\n<span class="st">---</span>\n\n<span class="st">&quot;</span> title tags))
    (write-file
     (expand-file-name file-name (concat (hakyll-site-location) <span class="st">&quot;posts&quot;</span>)))
    (switch-to-buffer file-name)))

(<span class="kw">defun</span><span class="fu"> hakyll-new-note </span>(title)
  <span class="st">&quot;Create a new Note with TITLE.&quot;</span>
  (interactive <span class="st">&quot;sTitle: &quot;</span>)
  (<span class="kw">let</span> ((file-name (hakyll-note-title title)))
    (set-buffer (get-buffer-create file-name))
    (markdown-mode)
    (insert (<span class="kw">format</span> <span class="st">&quot;---</span>\n<span class="st">title: %s</span>\n<span class="st">description: </span>\n<span class="st">---</span>\n\n<span class="st">&quot;</span> title))
    (write-file
     (expand-file-name file-name (concat (hakyll-site-location) <span class="st">&quot;notes&quot;</span>)))
    (switch-to-buffer file-name)))

(<span class="kw">defun</span><span class="fu"> hakyll-post-title </span>(title)
  <span class="st">&quot;Return a file name based on TITLE for the post.&quot;</span>
  (concat
   (format-time-string <span class="st">&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;</span>)
   <span class="st">&quot;-&quot;</span>
   (replace-regexp-in-string <span class="st">&quot; &quot;</span> <span class="st">&quot;-&quot;</span> (downcase title))
   <span class="st">&quot;.markdown&quot;</span>))

(<span class="kw">defun</span><span class="fu"> hakyll-note-title </span>(title)
  <span class="st">&quot;Return a file name based on TITLE for the note.&quot;</span>
  (concat
   (replace-regexp-in-string <span class="st">&quot; &quot;</span> <span class="st">&quot;-&quot;</span> (downcase title))
   <span class="st">&quot;.markdown&quot;</span>))</code></pre>
<p>I’m not much of a lisper, and it probably took me longer to write than the time it will save me, but that doesn’t matter. Firstly; it might be useful to somebody else, and so the cumulative time saved could be greater.</p>
<p>Secondly, my day job means I spend most of my coding time in Xcode, which can’t be customised as Emacs can be, and if I don’t spend time writing and learning lisp, I’ll have no chance of getting better at it.</p>
<p>So, I think it’s not bad as a first attempt, although it could obviously be refactored, and you can follow the history of it in my dotfiles <a href="https://github.com/Abizern/prelude/blob/master/personal/hakyll.el">repository</a> if you want to see how it could be developed (or even, you know, help me out with it).</p>

    <p>This site is now being generated by <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> instead of <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a></p>
<p>It’s something I’ve been planning on doing for a while, but feeling a bit burned out on Objective-C / Cocoa and facing a few days downtime over the seasonal holidays now was the time to actually do it.</p>
<p>Octopress is nice, and if you are just using the default theme, it’s easy to get up and running fairly quickly. But I found that updating the site for new versions of Octopress was fragile. I actually managed to break the installation, somehow, and that goes some way to explaining why there wasn’t much posted this year.</p>
<p>Hakyll is written in Haskell, and takes a little bit of work to get set up. Two things that make this a bit more difficult than normal. But, many people have made their site code public as <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/examples.html">examples</a>, and this is very useful in getting started. I hope that my source shows up in that list in due course. (<strong>Update</strong> - it is now!).</p>
<p>Despite what some wags may have said on <a href="https://twitter.com/alexrozanski/status/415797308220264448">Twitter</a>; it’s not actually that hip.</p>

    <p>London Web Standards is focusing on Git for their meeting on <a href="http://londonwebstandards.org/2013/05/lws-june-2013-gitdiet/">17th June</a>. I’m going to be talking on the topic of “Git’s not what you think it is”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You think you know Git? Really?</p>
<p>Are you using Git the same tired old way, checking in your changes and pulling from your colleagues? Do you get the sneaking feeling that others are having much more fun with it than you are?</p>
<p>Are you a refusenik, not tempted to use version control because its not for you?</p>
I’m going to challenge some common ideas about Git; I hope to get current users to be more expansive in their use of it, and maybe to bring some new users into the fold.

<p>I’ve been talking about <a href="https://alpha.app.net/abizern">Git</a> since 2009, which is when I became comfortable using it. I’ve heard some reasons for people not using it, or using it in its simplest form. My aim in this talk is to turn those statements on their head; maybe to get people to think about using git, not just as a set of task based recipes (which is a perfectly good way of working), but also to use the parts of it that seem too difficult, or poorly explained.</p>

    <p>This is how I roll, you might choose a different path.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Install Emacs. Get a nice, modern pre-built binary from <a href="http://emacsformacosx.com/">Emacs For Mac OS X</a>. It even supports fullscreen mode</p></li>
<li><p>Install <a href="http://batsov.com/prelude/">Emacs Prelude</a> which provides a useful, opinionated emacs environment which is easily configured.</p></li>
<li><p>Install clisp. I use homebrew so <code>brew install clisp</code> takes care of that for me.</p></li>
<li><p>Install <a href="http://quicklisp.org">quicklisp</a>; from Terminal go to a temporary directory and download quicklisp.lisp with <code>curl -O    http://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp</code>. Then run the lisp file from clisp with <code>clisp -i quicklisp.lisp</code>. As the instructions say, evaluate <code>(quicklisp-quickstart:install)</code>, and then evaluate <code>(ql:add-to-init-file)</code> to load quicklisp along with lisp.</p></li>
<li><p>Install Slime. While you have the clisp repl open, evaluate <code>(ql:quickload    &quot;quicklisp-slime-helper&quot;)</code>. After this runs, you will see some recommendations for what to put into your .emacs file. You don’t need to do this. I did say that Prelude was opinionated, and it’s done this for you. However, it’s not set up for clisp, so instead, add this to your <code>personal/personal.el</code> file: <code>(setq slime-default-lisp 'clisp)</code></p></li>
<li><p>And that should be it. You don’t need to have the clisp repl running in the terminal anymore, and you can delete the <code>quicklisp.lisp</code> file that you downladed, as it’s done it’s job of installation now.</p></li>
<li><p>Test the setup from Emacs by running <code>M-x slime-mode</code> and you’ll be taken to the lisp REPL.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now that’s done you can go on to the hard part of actually learning and using lisp.</p>
