  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the obligatory post announcing that I&#8217;ve moved this site off Wordpress
to <a href="http://Octopress.org" title="Octopress - The blogging framework for
hackers">Octopress</a>. It&#8217;s been almost a year since I posted anything. And most of what I
did publish was about <a href="http://nscodernightlondon.com" title="NSCoder
Night London's page">NSCoder Night</a>.</p>

<p>The old site had the Solarized Dark theme - and once I saw that the code
formatting on Octopress was that by default I decided to make the move. Now I
can happily write Markdown formatted posts with Emacs and see an almost live
preview of how it will look when published. I get to keep it on
<a href="http://github.com" title="GitHub">GitHub</a> and have it in a repository.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried to set the general colours to Solarized Light. Seems okay so far but
still plenty of room for tweeking.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It came about that I wanted to do some work with git and signed tags. It&#8217;s been
a while since I had looked at this, I&#8217;ve got some old entries up on keyservers
that date back to 1999, and never on a Mac.</p>

<p>It turns out that it is quite simple to set up a minimal
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">GPG</a> environment â€“ one that
lets you work on the command line without having to set it up for Mail.app. This
is about all I need it for.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.gpgtools.org/index.html">GPGTools project</a> has recently
resurrected the <a href="http://macgpg.sourceforge.net/">MacGPG project</a> to provide
email encryption and tools to the Mac. It is still in development, and I didn&#8217;t
want to mess about with my Mail installation so rather than install the complete
set of tools, I chose to install <a href="http://www.gpgtools.org/macgpg2.html">MacGPG2</a>
and <a href="http://www.gpgtools.org/keychain.html">GPGKeychain Access</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gpgtools.org/macgpg2.html">MacGPG2</a> is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#OpenPGP">OpenPGP</a>
implementation for the Mac. This installs gpg2 into /usr/local/bin and gpg is
symlinked to gpg2. I only mention this because although the commands can all be
issued as gpg, you get to the documentation by using man gpg2, not man
gpg. Installation is through an installer package.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gpgtools.org/keychain.html">GPGKeychain Access</a> does not integrate
with the Mac Keychain as the name might suggest, but provides a window to look
at and manage the keys that you have on your system. These are usually under
~/.gnupg/ Run the installer, and create your keys. It&#8217;s quite simple and there
is a video on the project page. However, there are a couple of things that you
should keep in mind. If you forget your passphrase you can&#8217;t use your private
key anymore. And if you&#8217;ve published the key, you won&#8217;t be able to revoke it and
it will just sit around on keyservers. So, set an expiry date on your keys in
case you do lose the private key or passphrase. As the expiry date comes up just
extend it again.</p>

<p>There is no key-server configured. There seems to be a ticket for this to be
implemented in some future milestone. Until then, create a file called gpg.conf
under ~/.gnupg and put this line in it:</p>

<pre><code>keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu
</code></pre>

<p>And that is just enough so that when you use the menu items that send and get
keys from keyservers they will work. As far as I know, these servers talk to
each other, so writing to one makes the key visible on the others.</p>

<p>Synchronisation of keys is an issue. If you are adventurous you could add more
entries to the gpg.conf file to use a central location for the keyrings,
somewhere like Dropbox or iDisk, so that all your machines can use the same
files. But, it&#8217;s just as easy to export the keys as text and use those files to
keep different machines in sync. Partcularly if you will be using gpg rarely.</p>

<p>This has been a companion piece to the non-Mac centric
<a href="http://365git.tumblr.com/">365Git</a> post about
<a href="http://365git.tumblr.com/post/2796779828/signing-a-git-tag">signed tags</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You may have seen John Gruber&#8217;s posts on
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/11/flash_free_and_cheating_with_google_chrome">uninstalling system-wide flash</a>
and
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/11/masquerading_as_mobile_safari">changing the Safari User Agent</a>
to view some sites that have Flash content.</p>

<p>The new MacBook Airs don&#8217;t have Flash installed by default so this is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read">tl:dr</a> summary
of those two articles so you don&#8217;t have to download and install the system-wide
Flash player.</p>

<p>Many sites, such as <a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a>, provide content in an
alternative format for devices that do not have Flash installed. Get access to
this from Safari by turning on the &#8216;Develop&#8217; menu (Preferences | Advanced) and
change the User Agent to &#8216;Mobile Safari 3.2.2 iPad&#8217;. This works per tab|window
so doesn&#8217;t change the display in what you already have open.</p>

<p>If this still doesn&#8217;t work (I&#8217;m looking at you
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/">iPlayer</a>) then you can use Google&#8217;s Chrome
browser, which comes with its own Flash plug-in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many times you will see a shortened url but you aren&#8217;t sure what it points
at. Here&#8217;s a little tip that I picked up from
<a href="http://tommorris.org">Tom Morris</a>.</p>

<p>Pop open your terminal, or console, or whatever your command-line application is
and type the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>curl --head shorturl
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This pops up a short amount of useful information about the target url. For
example the response for the Google short URL for this site shows this;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>~ % curl --head http://goo.gl/oQx8
</span><span class='line'>HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
</span><span class='line'>Content-Type: text/html; <span class="nv">charset</span><span class="o">=</span>UTF-8

<p>And you can see that the Location shows that you aren&#8217;t going to get
Rick-rolled.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I gave a short presentation to the London iPhone Developer Group at the Apple
store in London this week.</p>

<p>20 minutes is far too short to cover such a large subject but I did what I
could. I have been given another opportunity to present in the future and I&#8217;m
going to skip the boring beginner bits and just cover 3 or 4 advanced Git
techniques which should be more fun.</p>

<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, here are the slides. Probably not much help unless you were
there (I prefer more talk and less slides) and I apologise for being weak and

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;A coding dojo is a safe place to deliberately practice and develop your coding
skills.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went to my first
<a href="http://ldnpydojo.eventwax.com/london-python-code-dojo-season-2-episode-2">London Python Dojo</a>
last night and had a better time than I expected. I know a little
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language">Python</a>) (just
enough to hurt myself). I was intrigued by this event where the idea was to
learn together rather than just share knowledge.</p>

<p>The evening started off with beer and pizza, thanks to our hosts
<a href="http://www.fry-it.com/">Fry-IT</a>, and then moved on to two short
presentations. The first was on FluidDb and the second was something to do with
creating Python packages. Yes, both were over my head.</p>

<p>After that there was a short discussion about a problem to attempt. A blackjack
game was suggested and we split into 5 groups of four and had a little under an
hour to solve this. I didn&#8217;t have much confidence that we could do it. One
person sat at a laptop, we spent about 5 minutes deciding on the approach to use
and then the typing started.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to write the code as quickly as it was being knocked
out, but I could understand it. And although we were all talking there were no
arguments and we pushed through and got a working program done (with one easily
fixed bug) just in time. Although not strictly <a href="Pair%0Aprogramming">pair programming</a>, I can see why that approach can generate quality code quickly.</p>

<p>But that wasn&#8217;t it. Each team demoed their solution and showed their code. This
was just as useful as writing the program in the first place. Because we had all
been thinking about the same problem it was easy to understand the different
approaches that were presented. There were class based solutions as well as
functional ones (some had tests!) and we even saw the major development
environments - Macs running vi, Linux machines with Emacs, and Notepad++ on
Windows. We also saw a solution using Python3.</p>

<p>I enjoyed this more than I expected. It was nice to be able to contribute even
though I&#8217;m not that experienced with Python, and I learned plenty just by
watching and asking questions. It was a welcoming bunch and I will certainly be
going again. And this time I&#8217;ll pay more attention to people&#8217;s names.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think anybody used version control, though&#8230;</p>
