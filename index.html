    <p>This site is now being generated by <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> instead of <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a></p>
<p>It’s something I’ve been planning on doing for a while, but feeling a bit burned out on Objective-C / Cocoa and facing a few days downtime over the seasonal holidays now was the time to actually do it.</p>
<p>Octopress is nice, and if you are just using the default theme, it’s easy to get up and running fairly quickly. But I found that updating the site for new versions of Octopress was fragile. I actually managed to break the installation, somehow, and that goes some way to explaining why there wasn’t much posted this year.</p>
<p>Hakyll is written in Haskell, and takes a little bit of work to get set up. Two things that make this a bit more difficult than normal. But, many people have made their site code public as <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/examples.html">examples</a>, and this is very useful in getting started. I hope that my source shows up in that list in due course. (<strong>Update</strong> - it is now!).</p>
<p>Despite what some wags may have said on <a href="https://twitter.com/alexrozanski/status/415797308220264448">Twitter</a>; it’s not actually that hip.</p>

    <p>London Web Standards is focusing on Git for their meeting on <a href="http://londonwebstandards.org/2013/05/lws-june-2013-gitdiet/">17th June</a>. I’m going to be talking on the topic of “Git’s not what you think it is”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You think you know Git? Really?</p>
<p>Are you using Git the same tired old way, checking in your changes and pulling from your colleagues? Do you get the sneaking feeling that others are having much more fun with it than you are?</p>
<p>Are you a refusenik, not tempted to use version control because its not for you?</p>
I’m going to challenge some common ideas about Git; I hope to get current users to be more expansive in their use of it, and maybe to bring some new users into the fold.

<p>I’ve been talking about <a href="https://alpha.app.net/abizern">Git</a> since 2009, which is when I became comfortable using it. I’ve heard some reasons for people not using it, or using it in its simplest form. My aim in this talk is to turn those statements on their head; maybe to get people to think about using git, not just as a set of task based recipes (which is a perfectly good way of working), but also to use the parts of it that seem too difficult, or poorly explained.</p>

    <p>This is how I roll, you might choose a different path.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Install Emacs. Get a nice, modern pre-built binary from <a href="http://emacsformacosx.com/">Emacs For Mac OS X</a>. It even supports fullscreen mode</p></li>
<li><p>Install <a href="http://batsov.com/prelude/">Emacs Prelude</a> which provides a useful, opinionated emacs environment which is easily configured.</p></li>
<li><p>Install clisp. I use homebrew so <code>brew install clisp</code> takes care of that for me.</p></li>
<li><p>Install <a href="http://quicklisp.org">quicklisp</a>; from Terminal go to a temporary directory and download quicklisp.lisp with <code>curl -O    http://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp</code>. Then run the lisp file from clisp with <code>clisp-i quicklisp.lisp</code>. As the instructions say, evaluate <code>(quicklisp-quickstart:install)</code>, and then evaluate <code>(ql:add-to-init-file)</code> to load quicklisp along with lisp.</p></li>
<li><p>Install Slime. While you have the clisp repl open, evaluate <code>(ql:quickload    &quot;quicklisp-slime-helper&quot;)</code>. After this runs, you will see some recommendations for what to put into your .emacs file. You don’t need to do this. I did say that Prelude was opinionated, and it’s done this for you. However, it’s not set up for clisp, so instead, add this to your <code>personal/personal.el</code> file: <code>(setq slime-default-lisp 'clisp)</code></p></li>
<li><p>And that should be it. You don’t need to have the clisp repl running in the terminal anymore, and you can delete the <code>quicklisp.lisp</code> file that you downladed, as it’s done it’s job of installation now.</p></li>
<li><p>Test the setup from Emacs by running <code>M-x slime-mode</code> and you’ll be taken to the lisp REPL.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now that’s done you can go on to the hard part of actually learning and using lisp.</p>

                Missing Xcode Toolbar
            </a>

    <p>I’m sure you’ve been there.</p>
<p>You’re working in Xcode, and you have a file opened on another monitor in another window. Unfortunately, you forget about it, and when you close your project and reopen it again, the toolbar is missing.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://images.abizern.org/2013/01/Missing%20Xcode%20Toolbar.png" alt="Missing Toolbar" /><p class="caption">Missing Toolbar</p>
</div>
<p>nIt can be frustrating, because Xcode remembers this, and every time you open the project it will open without a toolbar. You can put it back by right-clicking in what is left of the toolbar and choosing one of the options.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://images.abizern.org/2013/01/Xcode%20Toolbar%20Menu.png" alt="Toolbar Menu" /><p class="caption">Toolbar Menu</p>
</div>
<p>But the gotcha that has bit me twice now, and prompted me to write this to remind myself of it, is that you need to choose the “Show Toolbar” menu item rather than one of the other two preferences. I was incorrectly choosing my preference of “Icon Only” and wondering why my preference wasn’t sticking.</p>

    <p>I wrote a <a href="http://abizern.org/fixbraces/">small rubygem</a> called <em>fixbraces</em> to move the opening brace of a conditional to the same line as the opening statement.</p>
<p>So now I can correct all the Xcode generated stubs that look like:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode objectivec"><code class="sourceCode objectivec">- (<span class="dt">void</span>)someMethod
{
    <span class="co">// some code here</span>
}</code></pre>
<p>Into my preferred format:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode objectivec"><code class="sourceCode objectivec">- (<span class="dt">void</span>)someMethod {
    <span class="co">// some code here</span>
}</code></pre>
<p>Which fits with my personal coding standards.</p>
