  <div class="entry-content"><p>On New Year&#8217;s eve, Dámasa asked me to calculate some fraction of a fraction and
provide the answer as a fraction in eighths. The post had just arrived so I
flipped over an envelope and started working it out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you need the answer in eighths?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m trying to convert a recipe and my scales only go down to eighths of an ounce.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just use grams?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>

<p>This little episode reminded me of an
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/alex_papadimoulis/archive/2005/05/25/408925.aspx">article</a>
by Alex Papadimoulis where he used the analogy of being asked whether it was
better to use a bottle or a shoe to pound a nail. Although there are situations
where either could be used, the real answer is, of course, to use a
hammer. Sometimes we are asked questions to which we can provide an answer; but
perhaps we should first stop and ask the reason for the question before
answering it.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> as an example. The
programmer&#8217;s question and answer site that is also a game. &#8216;Good&#8217; behaviour,
such as asking good questions, providing helpful answers, are rewarded by
upvotes, &#8216;bad&#8217; behaviour; lazy questions, incorrect answers, are discouraged by
downvotes. It is becoming increasingly common to find a Stack Overflow link as
the top hit when searching the web for answers to programming questions. But, if
you follow a mailing list for your chosen speciality it isn&#8217;t hard to see the
same question in both places and different approaches to answering them.</p>

<p>Stack Overflow&#8217;s
<a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/19665/the-help-vampire-problem/19673#19673">recommended approach</a>
to <a href="http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/">help vampires</a> is a pragmatic
one. Essentially, you can either be aloof and use the tools of the site to
discourage the behaviour; or you could just answer the question and get some
points. On a mailing list like, say, CocoaDev, a weak question will get sharp
answers (if any); but on Stack Overflow, somebody might just answer the question
because they get something out of it.</p>

<p>This might be useful to somebody. I&#8217;m sure there are times where we all just
need a quick answer to question without deeper knowledge. Get help with the
&#8216;how&#8217; to get something done, and pick up on the &#8216;why&#8217; later.  But read enough
questions in public forums and you&#8217;ll soon recognise those who just want to know
the &#8216;how&#8217;, and no amount of saying they need to learn the basics is going to
help. Maybe back up and ask why they are asking so you can better answer their
question.</p>

<p>To tie this back to fractions, have a look at this
<a href="http://republicofmath.wordpress.com/2010/01/08/richard-skemps-relational-understanding-and-instrumental-understanding/">Republic of Math post</a>
about the difference between relational and instrumental understanding in
mathematics. A particular example is how the invert and multiply method of
fractional division is widely taught without actually developing an
understanding of the operation itself. When I was 14 my elder brother taught me
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative">differentiation</a>. Not by saying
&#8220;subtract one from the exponent and multiply&#8221;, but rather by drawing a curve and
working through calculating a tangent using deltas and differences tending to
zero and how it led to the simpler method. I&#8217;ve long forgotten the hard way, but
after that I was very good at calculus.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is something to think about next time you see somebody ask how to
write an application without using Interface Builder.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://images.abizern.org.s3.amazonaws.com/2009/12/screenshot.png" alt="Heinlein theme image" /></p>

<p>The Hemingway wordpress theme used to be quite popular. I like
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway">Hemingway</a>, and I also like
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinlein">Heinlein</a>, so it seemed a good name for
 the theme of this rebranded site. I&#8217;ve brought a few of the posts over from the
 old place <a href="http://stompy.org">Stompy.org</a>, mostly to do with NSCoder Night in
 London.</p>

<p>There is more about this you can read in the
<a href="http://abizern.org/about">about page</a>. I also hold my hand up to stealing some
of the designs I used form <a href="http://nikf.org">Nik Fletcher</a> and
<a href="http://al3x.net/">Alex Payne</a> I&#8217;ve also got my eyes on some other sites that I
want to grab inspiration from. I make no claim to being a web developer, so feel
free to send constructive criticism. I haven&#8217;t finished with this yet.</p>

<p>They say that good artists borrow, and great artists steal. But real artists ship.</p>

<time datetime="2009-11-11T12:40:53+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Nov 11<span>th</span>, 2009</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We all know what we should be doing when writing code. Each methodology you
choose to use has it&#8217;s own best practices, whether it&#8217;s working from full
specifications, writing unit tests first, programming in pairs, yadda,
yadda. But, as developers, we&#8217;re only human, and we&#8217;re lazy. We have tools to
make things easy for us. Here are a few tips that you can use to help when
you&#8217;re not as rigorous in your coding as you should be.</p>

<h2>Use the static analyser.</h2>

<p>You can use the
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2009/08/mac-os-x-10-6.ars/9#compilers">Clang Static Analyser</a>
in Xcode by setting a build option. This will find a whole host of errors in
your code, even down to unconventionally named functions.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.abizern.org.s3.amazonaws.com/2009/11/ClangBuildSetting.png" alt="ClangBuildSetting.png" /></p>

<p>Now you can just code away and have the compiler pick up your mistakes when you
run &#8216;Build and Analyze&#8217; (⌘+Shift+A).</p>

<h2>Find your mistakes quickly.</h2>

<p>Any real application you develop will have a large number of resources that need
to be copied to your application bundle. The default projects that Xcode create
for you will copy these files first before compiling.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.abizern.org.s3.amazonaws.com/2009/11/XcodeDefault.png" alt="XcodeDefault.png" /></p>

<p>But, the lazy Xcoder knows that there are probably errors in the code that need
to get flagged by the compiler, so this copying is a waste of time. Reorder the
build steps by dragging so that the compilation is done first.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.abizern.org.s3.amazonaws.com/2009/11/XcodeRecommended.png" alt="XcodeRecommended.png" /></p>

<p>Your builds will now break early (and often!).</p>

<h2>Don&#8217;t fear the version controller.</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m going to stick my neck out and say that if you&#8217;re not using version control
you&#8217;re an idiot. The lazy Xcoder uses a powerful system that lets him or her
branch easily, make lots of little changes, and lots of mistakes (that can be
backed out). These changes can then be bundled into larger commits to be merged
into the main branch so that your co-workers don&#8217;t see what an idiot you&#8217;ve
been.</p>

<p>One such version control system is <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>. The lazy Xcoder
writes a bit of code, checks it in out of habit and then compiles. The compiler
picks up the mistakes, and he or she fixes them. Rather than make a new commit,
and retype the commit message, just call:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>git commit --amend -a -C HEAD
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will bring up the previous commit message in the editor, which you can
amend if you wish. This new commit will replace the previous one. The <code>-a</code>
option means you don&#8217;t even need to do a git add and the <code>-C HEAD</code> option means
it will use the commit message from the last commit.</p>

<p>Of course, if you&#8217;re a rockstar programmer, you don&#8217;t make mistakes at this
level. But I&#8217;m not, and I prefer to work with human nature rather than against
it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while ago, I read a
<a href="http://schinckel.net/2008/04/26/mercurial-with-os-x-gui-tools/">nice write up</a>
about using <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">mercurial</a> with
<a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> and
<a href="http://connectedflow.com/changes/">Changes</a>. Here&#8217;s how to do the same thing
with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> instead of
<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">mercurial</a>, separated into two parts in case you
just want to apply one set of changes.</p>

<h2>Changes Support</h2>

<p><strong>Step One: Make sure chdiff is installed.</strong></p>

<p>Open Changes.app and from the Changes menu select &#8220;Install terminal
utility&#8221;. This will install the chdiff utility which is used by the script.</p>

<p><strong>Step Two: Create a shell script to send diffs to Changes</strong></p>

<p>Create a shell script with the following contents.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>#!/bin/sh
</span><span class='line'>[ $# -eq 7 ] && /usr/bin/env chdiff "$2" "$5"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Where you save this and what you call it is up to you. Mine is called
&#8216;.gitchanges&#8217;, saved it at the root of my home directory. Make sure the script
is executable.</p>

<p><strong>Step Three: Edit the .gitconfig file to use this script to handle diffs.</strong></p>

<p>Open your <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file. This should already exist, at the very least it
will contain you name and email. under the section called <code>[diff]</code> add the
location and name of the file.  You may have to edit this to make sure it points
to the name and location you chose in Step Two. (Make sure to use the correct
path in your setup)</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[diff]
</span><span class='line'>external = &lt;path to file&gt;/.gitchanges</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>SubEthaEdit Support</h2>

<p><strong>Step One: Download and install the mode file for SubEthaEdit</strong></p>

<p>I wrote a SubEthaEdit mode for this which you can download from the
<a href="http://abizern.github.com/gitcommit.mode/">github project page</a>. Please feel
free to fork it and send me patches.</p>

<p><strong>Step Two: Edit the .gitconfig file to use SebEthaEdit as an external editor.</strong></p>

<p>Open your <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file. This time, under the <code>[core]</code> section, add the
following line:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[core]
</span><span class='line'>editor = /usr/bin/see -w -r -o new-window -j 'git editor' -m gitCommit -g 1:0</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>All those flags may seem daunting, but they are quite self-explanatory: the <code>-w</code>
flag makes the Terminal wait for a response from SubEthaEdit. <code>-r</code> brings
Terminal to the front after you&#8217;re done editing. <code>-o new-window</code> opens a new
window for editing. I prefer this to having a new tab appear in whatever window
I was working on. <code>-j 'git editor</code>&#8217; this sets the text that appears in the title
bar, which you can change as you wish. <code>-m gitCommit</code> is what sets the mode to
be used for editing. and <code>-g 1:0</code> puts the caret at the beginning of the file.</p>

<p>Now, when git asks you to write a commit message, or pick commits when running
<code>git rebase -i</code> a SubEthaEdit window will open as the commit message
editor. Make whatever changes you need then save the file (⌘-S) and then close
the window (⌘-W) for these changes to take effect.</p>

<p>The first London NSCoder Night was a success!</p>

<p>Eleven people turned up, travelling from as far as Brighton and Reading to join
in the fun. There was a mix of indies, learners, small Mac shops and students.</p>

<p>We started off upstairs at the <a href="http://bunchofgrapesborough.com/">Bunch of Grapes</a> and then moved to the outside area for more room. The tables outside are at a comfortable height for standing around so people were able to move around to different groups. There was a food, drink and talk and the laptops came out a few times as well.</p>

<p>We decided that this is going to be a regular event, held at the same place on the <strong>third Tuesday of the month</strong>. Next time I&#8217;ll book a table upstairs so we can sit down more comfortably. You don&#8217;t need to tell me you&#8217;re coming, but I&#8217;d appreciate an idea of how many people are going to make it so I can reserve approximately the right number of seats.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone for coming out. It was a great night and I hope you all went home with as much enthusiasm for coding as I did.</p>

<p>So, until the next time; follow <a href="http://twitter.com/nscodernightlon">@NSCoderNightLon</a> on Twitter and subscribe to the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/m5g6jb">iCal calender</a> to stay up to date.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s surprising that there isn&#8217;t an <a href="http://nscodernight.com">NSCoder Night</a>
chapter in London. There is a monthly CocoaHeads meeting in Swindon, and the UK
Mac Dev meeting once a month in Central London, but I think that there is a gap
for an evening of coding in a social setting.</p>

<p>So, in the spirit of &#8220;If you build it, they will come&#8221; I&#8217;m going to try and get
this started. So, this Tuesday, September 22, from about 7, let&#8217;s get together
at the <a href="http://bunchofgrapesborough.com">Bunch of Grapes</a> pub just behind London
Bridge Station
<a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=bunch+of+grapes+borough&amp;sll=51.50722,-0.089006&amp;sspn=0.006357,0.016973&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;radius=0.36&amp;split=1&amp;filter=0&amp;rq=1&amp;ev=zi&amp;ll=51.507454,-0.088019&amp;spn=0.006691,0.016973&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A&amp;iwd=1&amp;cid=16443485918241557592&amp;dtab=2">map</a>. Bring
a laptop (charged) and you can either sit and code or just chat with anyone
else. You can work on what you want. You don&#8217;t have to show anyone what you&#8217;re
working on; but feel free to ask and answer questions.</p>

<p>But, this is still just an experiment. Don&#8217;t know whether it will be a weekly or
a monthly event. I&#8217;m not even sure about the location. I was there last week and
the WiFi was a little flaky. There was a party upstairs so it was busy, but
there was a high turnover (as you would expect for a pub near a train
station). I still managed to get a table. But, unless we try and get together,
we won&#8217;t be able to answer these questions.</p>

<p>So, Come along tomorrow night. Follow
<a href="http://twitter.com/nscodernightlon">@NSCoderNightLon</a> on Twitter and subscribe
to the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/m5g6jb">iCal calender</a> for future meetings.</p>

<p>See you there.</p>
