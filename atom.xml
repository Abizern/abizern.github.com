    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a recent post up on the PeepCode Blog about
<a href="https://peepcode.com/blog/2012/commanding-your-text-editor">Commanding Your Text Editor</a>
which has some handy tips for Emacs, Vim, Textmate, Sublime Text and the OS
X. It&#8217;s a short read, and worth the time.</p>

<p>More and more of our time is spent at a keyboard typing, whether you&#8217;re a
programmer or not. Those of you who know me will have heard me talking about the
Dvorak keyboard layout and my current attraction to Emacs.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t have to go that far down the rabbit hole, but it&#8217;s surprising how many
Emacs bindings are supported natively on the Mac, and unlike Vim; you don&#8217;t need
to be in a different mode to use them.</p>

    <link href="http://abizern.org/2012/10/31/an-improved-reverse-words-script/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-31T09:19:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://abizern.org/2012/10/31/an-improved-reverse-words-script</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About 6 months ago I posted
<a href="http://abizern.org/2012/04/09/reverse-words-with-haskell/">a solution</a> to the
Google Code Jam problem
<a href="http://code.google.com/codejam/contest/351101/dashboard#s=p1" title="Original problem statement">Reverse Words</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve become more comfortable with Haskell since then, so here&#8217;s an improved solution.</p>

<!-- more -->




<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3986006.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code>module Main where

{-
Problem statement:
http://code.google.com/codejam/contest/351101/dashboard#s=p1

Run as a script with runghc, or compile with ghc --make -O2

input and output is by redirection;

$ ./reverse_words &lt; input_file &gt; output_file
 -}

import Control.Monad

main :: IO ()
main = do
  n &lt;- readLn
  forM_ [1..n] $ \i -&gt; do
    solution &lt;- fmap (unwords . reverse . words) getLine
    putStrLn $ &quot;Case #&quot; ++ show i ++ &quot;: &quot; ++ solution
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>I&#8217;m not one who believes that shorter, terser code is necessarily better, but
that isn&#8217;t what makes this version an improvement. Nor even the use of Monads;
Haskell&#8217;s sexy buzzword. I think this code is better because it has less noise
than the original solution.</p>

<p>Code Jam problems have well defined inputs and required outputs, and there is no
need to load the whole input file when the script starts. Normally, I would be
all for splitting out code into smaller, descriptively named functions, but in
this small case that&#8217;s just more typing and more lines getting in the way of the
actual solution. I think that this version is more readable because there are
less lines of code that don&#8217;t contribute directly to the solution.</p>

<p>And Code Jam has a time limit, so smaller code is faster to write and easier to
debug.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This used to be a thing until the iOS 6 and OS X 10.8 compatible
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSUUID_Class/Reference/Reference.html">NSUUID Class</a>
became available.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>New</h2>

<p>This is how you can do it now:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>UUID from NSUUID  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Old</h2>

<p>Here&#8217;s a method you can put in a class, with the correct ARC casts on ownership, that
returns a UUID. It&#8217;s a fairly common technique, and you&#8217;ll even see versions of
it where people have created a category on NSString for this.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>UUID from a method   </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And to use it:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>NSProcessInfo</h2>

<p>A common use for unique strings is to name files and directories
within a program so that they do not clash. Since iOS 2 and OS X 10.0 there has
been the <code>globallyUniqueString</code> method in
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSProcessInfo_Class/Reference/Reference.html">NSProcessInfo</a>
which returns a string that is unique for the network and process. So, for a
<em>good enough</em> unique string this is probably a better method to use:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Unique String from NSProcessInfo  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

    <link href="http://abizern.org/2012/08/20/on-live-coding/"/>
    <updated>2012-08-20T12:34:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://abizern.org/2012/08/20/on-live-coding</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read somewhere that part of the popularity of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing">The West Wing</a> was that it was
entertaining to watch smart people solve difficult problems. I think that&#8217;s part
of the reason why I find watching live coding videos so entertaining - It&#8217;s more
fun to watch someone solve a problem than doing it yourself.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There are plenty of screencasts you can find - <a href="http://youtubecom">YouTube</a> is
an obvious one, but don&#8217;t forget <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>Some good ones to watch are the
<a href="https://peepcode.com/screencasts/play-by-play">Play-By-Play</a> series produced by
<a href="http://peepcode.com">Peepcode</a> These screencasts have a developer solving a
problem set by the host as he talks to them about the choices they make and the
tools they use. Mostly Ruby / Railsy, but there are exceptions - Zed Shaw and
Python, Ryan Singer designing a UX workflow for the Web, Kyle Neath on UI
Workflow, and the latest has Tim Caswell creating a node.js web app.</p>

<p>These are not only interesting screencasts, with plenty to learn from, but I
find they are great for background noise. I work at home, and having the sounds
of a keyboard clacking and techy conversation pushes back the silence. Also,
when you look at a tutorial type blog post - or something on GitHub, all you see
is the finished product. But when you watch someone working, you realise that it
doesn&#8217;t come out fully formed like that, it sort of evolves. The same way that
you evolve code.</p>

<p>I did my own small one about
<a href="http://abizern.org/2012/04/09/reverse-words-with-haskell/">reversing words in Haskell</a>
a few months ago and I found that it&#8217;s harder to do than it looks. I credited
<a href="http://codinguncut.com/">Jonas Tullus</a> as an influence for that screencast and now
see that he has started <a href="http://codinguncut.com">Coding Uncut</a>, where he takes
on a problem and screencasts his solution in Haskell. This is harder to do than
the Peepcode ones, because without anyone asking you questions you become more
self-conscious about vocalising your thoughts.</p>

<p>Some of the things I&#8217;ve picked up from watching these are:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s okay to spend your time looking up the documentation. Knowing roughly
what approach to take to a solution and then looking up the details is more
important.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s faster to try something and see what happens rather than overthinking
everything from the beginning.</li>
<li>Version control is not an optional extra (okay, I already believe this, but
it&#8217;s nice to see that I&#8217;m not the only one).</li>
<li>It&#8217;s not the tool that matters - Emacs, Vim, JEdit, Paper and Sharpie - but
how you use it.</li>
<li>&#8220;It&#8217;s not about the code. It&#8217;s your understanding of the problem that you&#8217;re
working on.&#8221; - Zed Shaw</li>
</ul>

<p>The idea isn&#8217;t to create a rod for your back when writing code, but to put some
thought into the choices that are made when writing code so that it is consistent.</p>

    <id>http://abizern.org/2012/04/15/london-coderdojo</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I mentored at <a href="http://zen.coderdojo.com/dojo/74">CoderDojo London</a> this
weekend. These are just some of my thoughts about it.</p>

<!-- more -->




<blockquote><p>CoderDojo is a movement orientated around running free not-for-profit coding clubs and regular sessions for young people.</p><footer><strong>Coder Dojo site</strong> <cite><a href='http://coderdojo.com/about-us/'>coderdojo.com/about-us/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>A regular London chapter has formed, supported by and at the offices of
<a href="http://forwardtechnology.co.uk">Forward Technology</a>.  It takes place in their
canteen/theatre which has a nice tiered seating area and a miked up
presentation stand.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s still the Easter break, but 6 kids turned up with laptops ready to carry on
with projects they had already started and learn new stuff.  It started with a
presentation of what the day&#8217;s agenda was, which I mostly zoned out of as I was
busy churning through the Javascript tutorial on
<a href="http://codecademy.co.uk">Codecademy</a> which was going to covered. I&#8217;m not a web
developer so I didn&#8217;t want to show myself up.</p>

<p>After the opening talk the kids started burning through the tutorials at a
breakneck pace.  Where I went through them a bit slower; they hammered through
the interactive tutorial without (seemingly) worrying about learning what they
were doing. But that wasn&#8217;t the case.  Each succeeding question depended on
knowledge gained in the previous one, and they obviously had retained it. The
mentors watched them going through the exercises and answered questions.  I may
not know Javascript, but I can spot syntax errors and misspelled commands like a
BOSS.  So I wasn&#8217;t useless as I was worried I would be.</p>

<p>After that section (and after a few breaks - these are kids after all) Adam got
everyone to open
<a href="http://elucidatedbinary.com/recanvas">elucidatedbinary.com/recanvas</a> where you
can draw straight into web page and see the results right as you code. And then
step by step got them to follow along first creating a line, then a rectangle
then filling in the rectangle then drawing circles, arcs and trying to draw the
first initial of your name.</p>

<p>This was the most fun of the afternoon. Seeing the results instantaneously
really drove them along. They changed the points to see what would happen
without worrying about what they were doing. The mentors were kept busy helping
them with the syntax, explaing the difference between starting a line and
drawing a line, the coordinate system, points, colours, line thickness. These
were youngsters who don&#8217;t know their way about a keyboard as most of the rest of
us do, but I didn&#8217;t want to correct them because it would break the flow of what
they were doing. I had to draw the letter shapes on paper a couple of times and
walk them through the process of working out what the coordinates of each point
should be.</p>

<p>I showed one girl how to draw an arc on the canvas, went away and when I came
back she proudly showed me that she&#8217;d put two filled circles above the
arc to make a smiley face. Without being told to or shown how.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Helping kids program is hard. You can&#8217;t tell them to RTFM'>
One of the extra tasks was to modify a function to draw on the canvas when the
mouse was pressed. I saw one boy go to Stack Overflow, find a similar solution,
and then, rather than just copy-pasting the code, he turned to me and asked me
to explain <code>mousedown</code> to him. (A lesson that many people could stand to learn).
I tweeted about it later:
Helping kids program is hard. You can&#8217;t tell them to RTFM.
Since I would have to refer to the said FM to answer him properly,
I deferred the question to someone who knew what he was talking about.
</span></p>

<p>It was an energising experience. The program is in the early days yet, there
isn&#8217;t a program of tasks to cover. But the enthusiasm of the children and the
mentors is the driving force at the moment.</p>

<p>If you have or know of someone who would be interested in this. Either as a
mentor or a student, please, let them know about it. The sessions are free to
attend, take place in Camden Town on Saturdays between 12-3. You can sign up
with EventBrite, which gives an idea of how many attendees there will be and how
many mentors are available.</p>

    <updated>2012-04-15T15:08:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://abizern.org/2012/04/15/rotate-a-string-with-haskell</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I qualified for <a href="http://code.google.com/codejam">Google Code Jam</a> this year
answering 3 out of 4 questions. I have no illusions about progressing very far,
but I&#8217;m using it as an excuse to learn some Haskell and to write code faster.</p>

<p>As part of the learning process, I took one of my correct solutions over to the
nice folks at the #haskell channel over on freenode and asked if there was a
better way to do it. I learned something surprising.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>As part of the solution to the
<a href="http://code.google.com/codejam/contest/1460488/dashboard#s=p2">Recycled Numbers</a>
problem required turning a number such as 1234 into a list of numbers with the
digits rotated [4123, 3412, 2341]. User TSC2 in the channel gave me this simple
way of doing it:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>ghci console</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>ghci&gt; <span class="o">(</span><span class="se">\x</span>s -&gt; <span class="nb">let </span><span class="nv">n</span> <span class="o">=</span> length xs in <span class="o">(</span>tail . take n . map <span class="o">(</span>take n<span class="o">)</span> . tails . cycle<span class="o">)</span> xs<span class="o">)</span> <span class="s2">&quot;abcde&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;bcdea&quot;</span>,<span class="s2">&quot;cdeab&quot;</span>,<span class="s2">&quot;deabc&quot;</span>,<span class="s2">&quot;eabcd&quot;</span><span class="o">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I&#8217;m still new to this so I had to work it out on paper, but here is a step by
step explanation of what is happening: working from right to left as the
functions are evaluated:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>xs </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>"abcde"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><code>xs</code> is just the input string.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>cycle </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>"abcdeabcde..."</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><code>cycle</code> creates an infinite list out of the input list by repeating it. Haskell
is lazy. It doesn&#8217;t actually create the list until it actually needs it, so I&#8217;ve
added the ellpises just to show the concept that this is repeated infinitely.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>tails </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>["abcdeabcde...", "bcdeabcdea...", "cdeabcdeab...", "deabcdeabc...", ...]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is where things start to get interesting. <code>tails</code> creates a list out of
successive tails of a list. If you were to do this on a finite list you&#8217;d get a
list of smaller and smaller elements. For example:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But since our input is an infinite we now have an infinite list of infinite
lists, each element starting at one letter in from the original list. Remember,
this hasn&#8217;t actually been worked out yet.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>map (take n) </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>["abcde", "bcdea", "cdeab", "deabc", "eabcd" "abcde", ...]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><code>take n</code> takes the first <code>n</code> elemets of a list. Our lambda expression defines
this as the length of the list, which is 5. And <code>map</code> applies this to each
element of the list. So now we have an infinite list of 5 element lists. which is
closer to our required final output.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>take n </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>["abcde", "bcdea", "cdeab", "deabc", "eabcd"]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Applying <code>take n</code> again to the infinite list takes the first 5 elements of the
finite list</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>tail </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>["bcdea", "cdeab", "deabc", "eabcd"]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Applying <code>tail</code> to the finite list takes all but the first element, and we get
the output that we were looking for. Even though along the way we had an
infinite list of infinite lists.</p>

<p>And yet all Haskell did was provide a promise (a <em>thunk</em> in functional terms)
that it would provide the answer when it was asked for, and as the function
progressed the infinite list of infinite list became an infinite list of finite
lists and then a finite list. And still it didn&#8217;t actually resolve all those
calls until it was actually needed. In this case, when the <em>ghci</em> interpreter
tried to get a string to display on the screen.</p>

<p>Freaky or what?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while ago I answered a couple of questions on Stack Overflow using my
<code>.gitignore</code> file as an example. I find it strangely satisfying to find that
there are projects on GitHub that use it, and even the odd blogs has put it up
as well.</p>

<p>I might as well have it on my own site:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s particularly suited for Xcode. It excludes the workspace settings, which
also includes the breakpoints, so don&#8217;t be surprised if they don&#8217;t carry over in
clones. It also excludes the build schemes unless you mark them as shared.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got this as a global ignore file for my system - and if I&#8217;m going to push a
repository elsewhere I just copy it into the repo&#8217;s directory.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s simple to do. If you&#8217;re not familiar with ignore files I&#8217;ve written about

    <updated>2012-03-18T08:44:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://abizern.org/2012/03/18/simple-localisation-testing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you want to test your localisations but you don&#8217;t want to go through the hassle of
changing the settings on the simulator, or device, or your Mac for each one. There&#8217;s always the fear
of setting some language that you don&#8217;t understand.</p>

<p>But, with Xcode4 schemes and a little argument passing this is a lot easier than it used to be. You
can set up a scheme for each localisation which will let you run your iOS or Mac app under that
localisation without having to change any settings.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Just to make it easier, you can have a look at an example Xcode Workspace that I&#8217;ve
<a href="https://github.com/Abizern/SimpleLocalisationTesting" title="Simple Localisation
Testing">put up on Github</a>. This has two projects within it, one for the Mac and one for the iPhone.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.abizern.org/2012/03/Schemes.png" width="631" height="111" title="Xcode Schemes" ></p>

<p>Start by having a look at the schemes. There are two projects with two schemes each, one for each
localisation. Handily named so you can tell which is for which.</p>

<p><img class="top" src="http://images.abizern.org/2012/03/RunAction_en.png" width="525" height="135" title="en run action" ></p>

<p><img class="top" src="http://images.abizern.org/2012/03/RunAction_es.png" width="525" height="133" title="en run action" ></p>

<p>If you have a a look at the run action for these schemes you can see the arguments that I am
passing. First the <code>-AppleLanguages</code> argument and then the two character country code (with the
brackets back-slash escaped).</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all there is to it. Now you just have to pick the scheme to run and it will load up that
localisation without you having to change it on the simulator. It even works for running debug
builds on the device.</p>

<p>Of course, you should test it properly eventually, but while you are developing, it&#8217;s a quick way to
get feedback about how your localisations appear.</p>

<p>The old site had the Solarized Dark theme - and once I saw that the code

can happily write Markdown formatted posts with Emacs and see an almost live

    <id>http://abizern.org/2011/01/17/just-enough-gpg-for-git</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It came about that I wanted to do some work with git and signed tags. It&#8217;s been
a while since I had looked at this, I&#8217;ve got some old entries up on keyservers
that date back to 1999, and never on a Mac.</p>

<p>It turns out that it is quite simple to set up a minimal
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">GPG</a> environment – one that
lets you work on the command line without having to set it up for Mail.app. This
is about all I need it for.</p>

<!-- more  -->


<p>The <a href="http://www.gpgtools.org/index.html">GPGTools project</a> has recently
resurrected the <a href="http://macgpg.sourceforge.net/">MacGPG project</a> to provide
email encryption and tools to the Mac. It is still in development, and I didn&#8217;t
want to mess about with my Mail installation so rather than install the complete
set of tools, I chose to install <a href="http://www.gpgtools.org/macgpg2.html">MacGPG2</a>
and <a href="http://www.gpgtools.org/keychain.html">GPGKeychain Access</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gpgtools.org/macgpg2.html">MacGPG2</a> is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#OpenPGP">OpenPGP</a>
implementation for the Mac. This installs gpg2 into /usr/local/bin and gpg is
symlinked to gpg2. I only mention this because although the commands can all be
issued as gpg, you get to the documentation by using man gpg2, not man
gpg. Installation is through an installer package.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gpgtools.org/keychain.html">GPGKeychain Access</a> does not integrate
with the Mac Keychain as the name might suggest, but provides a window to look
at and manage the keys that you have on your system. These are usually under
~/.gnupg/ Run the installer, and create your keys. It&#8217;s quite simple and there
is a video on the project page. However, there are a couple of things that you
should keep in mind. If you forget your passphrase you can&#8217;t use your private
key anymore. And if you&#8217;ve published the key, you won&#8217;t be able to revoke it and
it will just sit around on keyservers. So, set an expiry date on your keys in
case you do lose the private key or passphrase. As the expiry date comes up just
extend it again.</p>

<p>There is no key-server configured. There seems to be a ticket for this to be
implemented in some future milestone. Until then, create a file called gpg.conf
under ~/.gnupg and put this line in it:</p>

<pre><code>keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu
</code></pre>

<p>And that is just enough so that when you use the menu items that send and get
keys from keyservers they will work. As far as I know, these servers talk to
each other, so writing to one makes the key visible on the others.</p>

<p>Synchronisation of keys is an issue. If you are adventurous you could add more
entries to the gpg.conf file to use a central location for the keyrings,
somewhere like Dropbox or iDisk, so that all your machines can use the same
files. But, it&#8217;s just as easy to export the keys as text and use those files to
keep different machines in sync. Partcularly if you will be using gpg rarely.</p>

<p>This has been a companion piece to the non-Mac centric
<a href="http://365git.tumblr.com/">365Git</a> post about
<a href="http://365git.tumblr.com/post/2796779828/signing-a-git-tag">signed tags</a>.</p>

and
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/11/masquerading_as_mobile_safari">changing the Safari User Agent</a>
to view some sites that have Flash content.</p>

<p>The new MacBook Airs don&#8217;t have Flash installed by default so this is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read">tl:dr</a> summary
of those two articles so you don&#8217;t have to download and install the system-wide
Flash player.</p>

<p>Many sites, such as <a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a>, provide content in an
alternative format for devices that do not have Flash installed. Get access to
this from Safari by turning on the &#8216;Develop&#8217; menu (Preferences | Advanced) and
change the User Agent to &#8216;Mobile Safari 3.2.2 iPad&#8217;. This works per tab|window
so doesn&#8217;t change the display in what you already have open.</p>

<p>If this still doesn&#8217;t work (I&#8217;m looking at you
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/">iPlayer</a>) then you can use Google&#8217;s Chrome
browser, which comes with its own Flash plug-in.</p>

<p>Pop open your terminal, or console, or whatever your command-line application is

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;A coding dojo is a safe place to deliberately practice and develop your coding
skills.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went to my first
<a href="http://ldnpydojo.eventwax.com/london-python-code-dojo-season-2-episode-2">London Python Dojo</a>
last night and had a better time than I expected. I know a little
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language">Python</a>) (just
enough to hurt myself). I was intrigued by this event where the idea was to
learn together rather than just share knowledge.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The evening started off with beer and pizza, thanks to our hosts
<a href="http://www.fry-it.com/">Fry-IT</a>, and then moved on to two short
presentations. The first was on FluidDb and the second was something to do with
creating Python packages. Yes, both were over my head.</p>

<p>After that there was a short discussion about a problem to attempt. A blackjack
game was suggested and we split into 5 groups of four and had a little under an
hour to solve this. I didn&#8217;t have much confidence that we could do it. One
person sat at a laptop, we spent about 5 minutes deciding on the approach to use
and then the typing started.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to write the code as quickly as it was being knocked
out, but I could understand it. And although we were all talking there were no
arguments and we pushed through and got a working program done (with one easily
fixed bug) just in time. Although not strictly <a href="Pair%0Aprogramming">pair programming</a>, I can see why that approach can generate quality code quickly.</p>

<p>But that wasn&#8217;t it. Each team demoed their solution and showed their code. This
was just as useful as writing the program in the first place. Because we had all
been thinking about the same problem it was easy to understand the different
approaches that were presented. There were class based solutions as well as
functional ones (some had tests!) and we even saw the major development
environments - Macs running vi, Linux machines with Emacs, and Notepad++ on
Windows. We also saw a solution using Python3.</p>

<p>I enjoyed this more than I expected. It was nice to be able to contribute even
though I&#8217;m not that experienced with Python, and I learned plenty just by
watching and asking questions. It was a welcoming bunch and I will certainly be
going again. And this time I&#8217;ll pay more attention to people&#8217;s names.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think anybody used version control, though&#8230;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been inspired by Pieter Omvlee of
<a href="http://bohemiancoding.com">Bohemian Coding</a> and his
<a href="http://365Cocoa.tumblr.com">365Cocoa</a> to set up my own contribution.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to try and and fill a year with <a href="http://git-scm.com">git</a> tips and
inspirations over at <a href="http://365git.tumblr.com">365git</a>. I’ve got a few weeks
worth of ideas but if anyone wants to know anything or has a suggestion, I’ll
gratefully consider them.</p>
